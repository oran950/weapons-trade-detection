Is it body mass? The differences in anatomy?  Like I get it would probably suck and be a sterilization nightmare but I can't figure out why a cow would survive a C-section, but a human woman attended by a skilled surgeon wouldn't.\n\nETA: To clarify, because I don't think I was very clear. I'm not wondering \"Well animals seem to survive it, why don't we do at home c-sections?\", I'm wondering why all the vet resources I look at can be summed us as \"Not ideal, but it happens and she's got better than average odds\" but the handful of times I've seen it discussed regarding humans is \"this will 1000% kill you. That's right, every at home c-section kills 11 woman.\"",

      "content": "I beat the game yesterday (I preordered the deluxe), I really wanted to love this game, it has so much going for it. I love the town, the atmosphere. The enemy designs are amazing and grotesque and initially I thought this may be one of my favourite SH games ever, but by the end of it, it just fell flat.\n\nI think the Shrine parts of the game absolutely kill it. They're just not fun at all and take away from the anricipation of wanting to spend the game in and explore the town. Having to do the typical find 3 of this or 3 of that in a maze like puzzle was just so tedious.\n\nAlso some of the mechanics were just inconsequential, such as the insanity mechanic which I felt posed no challenge at all in the game to the point where I forgot it was even there.\n\nThe durable weapons felt like it was tacked on, Why? I have no idea. I guess they thought people loved it from BOTW and thought let's throw it in there. That too felt inconsequential and I didn't feel it came into play at all except during the end, once when the game started throwing tons of enemies at you.\n\nBut the thing I hated the most is the typical Capcom style, end game where they decide to throw all the enemies at you and the kitchen sink. While I think the combat is passable, it just isn't fun to the point where I wanna do it again and again and again in a short time span. It just became annoying and at that point I just kept saying to myself, for the love of God, just gimme the final boss and end it already. I just didn't enjoy how much combat there was at the end game. Less is more with horror.\n\nThe game went from what I initially would say would be a 9 to like. 6 or a 7 at the end. There's so much to like, but a lot of areas which ruin it sadly.\n\nSH f, is really not a bad game, I think quite a few will enjoy it, especially new comers. But for me it just felt very ok. \n",

Games like Texas chainsaw massacre, evil dead, battlefront 2, all are games I love but when the limited roster size only allows one of each character it sucks to have to worry about not getting your guy. I personally like to max one character at a time and exclusively play them until I do because then once I switch to the next character it feels like a whole new game prolonging my interest in the game. People generally won't always buy the dlc characters, but I have no issue paying 7 bucks for a character if it offers me an advantage/exclusive abilities. It doesn't matter if it's PvE, but I want that feeling that I know my character won't be stolen every game.\n\n\nHOWEVER, you know how all old Gun and Illfonic games get put on P2P servers and you can earn xp and rewards killing bots? I'd be just as happy with that, and would actually prefer it like that",

      "title": "Found out boyfriend got a naked lap dance on the day we found out I was pregnant, I flew off the handle and slapped him and broke things. Full of remorse. 35F 37M",
      "content": "33 F & BF 37 M\n\nSo, on Saturday I found out that my boyfriend of 5 years went to a stripclub on the day we found out I was pregnant with our first child and received a naked lap dance whilst I was at home. Lapdances involved sexual stimulation in the form of grinding, and touching. In my eyes, this is cheating, I know the stripper obviously has no interest in my boyfriend, I think the fact he has willingly paid to receive a dance and touch another naked woman is cheating. Whilst perhaps I haven’t explicitly said to him ‘if you get a lap dance one day I’m done’ I have whenever the subject has come up, made it clear I wouldn’t be comfortable with it, and the fact he went on the night we found out we were pregnant just felt like a punch to the stomach. \n\nI asked him where he went on the night that it happened, at this point he didn’t know I knew, and he bareface lied to me. I did this to essentially give him the chance to come clean. I continued to question him, and it was only when it became obvious I knew he admitted it. He clearly therefore knew it was an issue and that id be upset by this. \n\nI’d like to start the next part of what happened with the following - not ONCE in 5 years, 3 of those living together, have I ever even shouted at him, we have had a very calm, loving, healthy relationship up until now. I have never ever had even a shred of doubt in him and my trust for him. I believe he and our relationship was pretty perfect. He has been a truly amazing partner, and I have been good to him and shown him the upmost respect I believe he deserved. \n\nI never thought I had it in me to behave how I did next. In the moment, when he admitted it, I screamed at him and threw my can of drink on the floor and ran upstairs. He followed me, and at that point I am screaming and crying, calling him names. \n\nWhat proceeded after this was nothing short of a nightmare, and I am so incredibly ashamed for the way I handled things. I felt so incredibly hurt, betrayed, and like our entire future was ruined. I felt he was continuing to lie to me and play things down. However, there is absolutely no excuse for how I handled my hurt and anger. And I have spent the past 2 days absolutely hating every ounce of myself for my reaction/s\n\nSo, across the 3 day period after this came to light, it was a constant battle and shouting match. Constant questioning, constant crying, wondering how he could do that to me whilst I’m pregnant, calling out entire future into question. Barely a wink of sleep. Questioning whether I could even have the baby when the foundations of our relationship, the trust, was broken. It was killing me. \n\nI slapped him on the back on the evening when initially finding out. The next morning, I whacked him on the arm and slapped his chest when continuing to question him and feeling lied to. I asked him to show me exactly how the lap dance was (yes probably a bad choice), and when he showed me a video of the sort of thing it was like, and told me his hands were all over her body, including her bum and breasts, I completely lost it and pinched his shoulder, threw our phones across the room, smashed the hoover on the floor, emptied some bath oils he had bought me as a gift on to the floor, and threw my make up bag across the room, and tbh several other things in my vicinity - I was just throwing anything and everything in my path in complete blind rage. I felt absolutely out of control. He grabbed me to try and stop me by the wrists and I was trying to get away and his hands off of me, and I’ve spat at him. The most disgusting act a human can do to another human. I’ve then, after this 3 minutes of madness, landed on a heap on the floor crying and in pain like I’ve never ever felt from the hurt of it all. \n\nI’ve eventually reached a point where I am starting to feel forgiveness towards him. I am of course questioning whether I can trust him going forward. But his remorse and the fact in 5 years he has legitimately been the most supportive, caring, wonderful partner, says more to me about him than a lapse in judgement. But it’s taken me 6 days to get to that point. For 3 days amidst the nightmare and chaos, my only thoughts were around the fact - I cannot trust another word he says, he’s clearly lied before, if he can disrespect me on the day we find out I’m pregnant then when else has he been doing things like this. I couldn’t look at him the same and I felt hurt and emotions like I’ve never ever felt.\n\nI am now struggling more with my actual reaction. Please don’t take this as me trying to defend myself of make excuses, but across our relationship, before this, I have never ever even called him a bad name. It’s gone from that, to me crossing lines I never ever on my wildest dreams did I think I was capable of crossing, and I don’t know if I can ever forgive myself. He doesn’t seem phased by my reaction and thinks I am giving myself too hard a time. He’s saying context matters, that if I’d shown a pattern of behaviour like this before or if I’d physically responded in this way over something trivial like him not making dinners then he’d of course be gone. But regardless of his feelings around it, I just cannot believe I reacted like this, and I’ll NEVER be able to take it back. I’ll never be able to say I haven’t slapped my partner, or spat, or showed levels of disrespect only the worst kind of human can show. I think I need to break up with him, not because of what he did anymore, but because what I’ve done in my reaction, as no one deserves that and I feel like he’s now a victim, who deserves so much more. I’m 11 weeks pregnant, and I was so looking forward to starting a family and life together, and I feel like that’s now down the drain and we need to start afresh separately. He doesn’t want this, he thinks we can move past this, that everyone makes mistakes and they don’t have to define our whole relationship, but I just can’t comprehend how with these lines being crossed we could really be the same. \n\nI wish more than anything in the world that in the moment on anger and hurt, I walked away, went out, didn’t lash out. 3 days of absolute chaos and madness instead. \n\nI’ve already spoken to my therapist about this. I’m just struggling so much right now and would appreciate any advice, insights, opinions. Do you think there is a way forward for us?\n\nThank you if you’ve got this far x \n",

Same night after sex she sang \"You do a line, and I'll do a line, HONEEEY\" from the same episode.\n\n\\* Before sex she showed me a clip from S10E01 where chef takes the kids to a strip club and said that's what I'm gonna do to you in reference to what the stripper did to chef.

      "title": "My’f19’ boyfriend’m21’ said he misses his independence before we got together. We live together and I have nowhere to go",
      "content": "My ‘F19’ boyfriend ’M21’ and I have been together for 9 months. We’ve known each other for 4 years and about a month into our relationship, he moved in with my father and I. \n\nMy father has bipolar and was very abusive my whole life. He sexually assaulted me multiple times as a child, he would physically assault me, but knew just how far to take it without leaving marks on my body so he wouldn’t get in trouble, he would get very loud and violent if I didn’t do something right. It was hell living with him but at the time, it was the only stable place I could live. \n\nHowever I became extremely depressed and had extreme panic attacks every day. My anxiety was through the roof and I would wake up every morning with pains in my chest so bad I felt like I was going to explode. I work at a smoke shop and one of my friends recommended 7OH(kratom) for my anxiety. It just so happened that we sell them at the shop so I started taking them to mitigate my anxiety and depression, and it worked. But I slowly started increasing my dose because my tolerance started building up so I had to take more to get the same effect. \n\nAbout 7 months of us living there together, my boyfriend decided he had enough of living at the house. My father was very mean to him too and it was affecting his mental health so he offered for both of us to move in with his family. His family are very supportive, and let us bring my cat and snake as well as all of my furniture there and we moved everything into his room. \n\nA few days into us living there, my boss told me the department of agriculture was coming in to confiscate the 7OH because it’s now a schedule 1 substance and it’s illegal to sell, so before they came he let me take the rest of what we had in stock to keep because we wouldn’t be able to make money off of it anyway. My boyfriend seemed fine with it as he knew it helped me tremendously with my anxiety. \n\nAbout a month into us living with his family, he started becoming more distant. He wasn’t as affectionate with me anymore, but I figured it was just stress related to his new job and big life changes. \n\nAbout a week ago, he invited his online friends from out of state to visit for a few days, and he invited me to hang out with them. We were gonna go to the beach, clubbing, kayaking, thrifting, etc. I took 4 days off of work to spend time with them. Two days before they flew down, we had a fight. He said he was concerned about me self medicating with the 7OH and although it didn’t change my personality, he was worried about my health. \n\nHe also wanted me to quit my job because he was worried I would relapse, that I wouldn’t be able to show proof of income when we get an apartment because I get paid under the table, and that I could get hurt because sometimes weird people come in. \n\nWe don’t sell 7OH at the shop anymore so I wouldn’t have access to it, there’s many ways around showing income and I make more than him because I don’t get income tax and it’s extremely hard to find a job in this area that pays more than what I’m making, and there’s weird people everywhere. It happens just as much as it did at every other job I’ve had. I love my job, I love the area I work in and I love my regulars. I really don’t want to quit a job I love. \n\nBut he took this as me invalidating his feelings and making excuses instead of respecting his wishes. He said he needed a break from me and that he didn’t want me coming with him to visit his friends anymore. He became extremely cold to me and wouldn’t talk to me at all that night. I was terrified and confused that something else was going on because it was such a huge change in character for him. \n\nThat night, i made a mistake. I took his phone and started going through his messages. I’ve never done this to him or anyone before and I didnt think he was cheating on me, I just had a gut feeling that there was something or someone influencing this because it was extremely sudden and very unlike him. I opened his most recent message and it was one of his coworkers. He had been texting her all day, way more than he texts me, and she was hearting all of his messages. This made me extremely insecure and afraid. 10 seconds later he bursts through the bathroom door and says “give me the phone or we’re done” I gave the phone back and he reassured me that she’s just a coworker and that nothing is going one between them. \n\nThe next morning he left. He was gone for 4 days and during that time I was able to get a suboxone prescription to stop taking the 7OH and started looking into other jobs. I got rid of all of the 7OH I had.  I didn’t want to let this get in the way of our relationship. I love him more than anything and I didn’t realize it was affecting him that much. I felt so bad that he was probably bottling this up and didn’t know how to tell me but I would never let this stupid addiction get in the way of us. \n\nWhen he came back I explained to him that I’m making the steps to get better and find a new job, but he said he still wants space. He said he misses being independent and misses the routine he had before we were together. I recommended we both get therapy and find hobbies and make time to hang out with our own friends so that we’re not always together. I told him I can understand how it feels to not have your own life when we’re always together, and it’s important to have an identity outside the relationship. Maybe we became too codependent but I want to work on us because our relationship means everything to me but he said he can’t be happy living with someone and he doesn’t want to be committed to anyone right now and needs to live alone. \n\nThis is devastating to me because I dropped everything to make the jump to live with him and now I have nowhere to go. Im trying so hard to be the partner he wants and I want to give him his space but I don’t make enough to get an apartment by myself. I don’t want to sleep next to someone I’m in love with who treats me like a friend. I don’t have any family to go to and I don’t have any friends that don’t live with their parents. I’m so lost and I don’t know what to do. It kills me coming home every day to someone I’m madly in love with who is cold to me like this. It’s tearing me apart. What can I do or say to keep this relationship?",

      "title": "I (24M) have been dealing with sexual issues with my girlfriend (22f)  for almost a year now with still no change. Is this worth ending the 2 years relationship over?",
      "content": "Hi so to get things started. For almost about a year now (since late October 2024) me and my girlfriend have not had sex And since January of this year she hasn’t done anything sexually for me at all. I lost my virginity to her and so it was a pretty deep connection I had with her. I wasn’t waiting for the “right one” per se but it finally felt comfortable for me to do it with her. And so after a couple months, around March of this year I had brought it up. It was just a short conversation she heard me out and she said she would work on it and that was that. \n\nThen in May I had brought it up again and it was more in depth. I had asked her if it was me or something I did, if there was someone else, if she wasn’t attracted to me, if it was because of her past (because I do know with her ex there was some issue that affected her) and her answer to all of this was no. So I asked what it was and she said she doesn’t have an answer for me. I let her know I would help and support her with whatever it is that’s bothering her. Around this time she said she would also be moving away to school an hour away for a year. I had let her know I’m not good with long distance but I would obviously try it. \n\nThen cut to July and we had a 3rd conversation where we almost broke up. We almost broke up but I was caught lying about having a vape and this is when I brought up the lack of sexual interaction again. Long story short we made a plan for both of us. I would stop vaping (or at the very least not owning one and only hitting one when out at bars) and she would seek therapy to hope this can help with her sexual issues. But we both set a timeline for ourselves, the end of October and if we can’t hold up our end of the bargain we would end things. But she said that she won’t be able to start therapy until school starts because of her benefits from school so it wouldn’t be until September \n\nI have since not owned a vape and so I’ve held up my end of the bargain. But now we’re at the end of September and she has done no research into looking for therapy or starting it. At this point, she’s been in school for a month. She’s settled into her new life and routine in her new city, she’s made friends, gotten a job there. She’s been settled in, but she has yet to do any research into seeking therapy. It took me about 2 minutes of research to see how she could get therapy benefits from school and where she could go and how to use those benefits but I haven’t told her because this is her part, if she truly cared about me and us this is something I believe she should be doing. I also don’t want to remind her to do this because again, this is something she should be doing if it’s such a priority, she knows there’s consequences that we both agreed to if we can’t hold up our end of the bargain. \n\nI fully understand that she’s busy and has school, work, and new relationships to take care of. But there’s been so many instances where she texts me saying how she’s so bored or how she’s done nothing all day or how she’s again going out with her friends and I just think to myself how she could easily be looking into this therapy if it’s such a priority to her which it should be if she wants us to work. She constantly says how much she loves and cares for me but her actions are not showing it. \n\nIt was also the 8 year anniversary of my mom passing this past week and the other 2 years she’s texted me days leading up to it and day of saying how she’s there for me and will give me space if I need it on that day which I truly loved and appreciated, but this year she completely forgot. We started the day by her picking up on an argument we had the night before that we had resolved and I did respond. By noon of her randomly texting me what she was doing throughout the day I had accepted she forgot. She had work at 4pm that day and I made a memorial post on my instagram story for my mom. She had her entire morning and afternoon free. No homework nothing and she didn’t text me. She went to work and when she got off at midnight she goes and texts me “oh I just saw your story I’m sorry baby :( if I knew it was that day I wish I could’ve helped in some way” which was an absolute knife to my heart because that’s the response I got. \n\nWe obviously had an argument about it and she understood where I was coming from obviously and took accountability of her actions and she also said that the date will now be in her calendar from now on. But not only did it hurt me (and still hurt me) because she forgot it. It’s the way that her response was so short and there was no thought to it. It felt like the final nail in the coffin because again her actions are not speaking louder than her words on how she cares for me because she knows how much of a hard day that is for me. I had ended that argument with “I want you to take responsibility for the important things in our relationship” to almost kind of nudge and remind her about the therapy thing because I want her to fully do this on her own without my help. \n\nI just don’t know if I’m making the right decision on wanting to end things with her. I’ve given her many chances to help herself and us and she still isn’t doing anything to change it. The people I’ve talked to have said that me giving her almost a year to try and help fix the no sexual interaction with me with no answer on why she’s even doing that has been plenty. And I still do love her. But I just don’t think I love her in a relationship way anymore",

      "content": "Lots of movies have court scenes. Movies often take a lot of liberties with the procedures of trials in order to make things less boring and more cinematic. But sometimes the liberties go a bit too far and the trial leads to nonsensical results that wouldn't happen in a normal court, often because they go against the law and precedent.\n\nSometimes, it's intentional, we're meant to see that the system is being rigged, either to protect the rich and powerful, or to oppress marginalized minorities. But usually, no such commentary is being made, we're just meant to assume that this is a normal court operating in a normal manner making a perfectly normal and legal ruling.\n\nFor example, in Con Air, Nicolas Cage's character clearly killed some thugs in self-defense to protect his wife, but the Judge despite accepting this premise throws the book at him anyway because he thinks that his military training means that he should be held to higher standards.\n\nIn Nightmare on Elm Street, Freedy Krueger gets away with murdering 20 children because “someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place.” In reality, not only would this not invalidate the search as long as the Judge still testifies that he authorized the warrant, it wouldn't matter because as long as the cops believed that the warrant was valid, the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine doesn't apply. Not to mention, there was far more evidence than just what was found in Freddy's house, including multiple witnesses. One of the few things I will credit the remake for is that they didn't bother with this plot point, the parents took revenge on Freddy before there even was a trial.\n\nAnd then there's The Untouchables, where the judge finds out that the jury was bribed by Al Capone (which actually happened), so he just tells the jury from the courtroom next to them to switch places in the middle of a trial (which definitely isn't how that happened and is very much illegal). This causes Al Capone's lawyer to change his plea from not guilty to guilty without even consulting his client (again, obviously very illegal and didn't happen).\n\nSo what other court scenes and rulings in movies do you think went way too far in being too unrealistic?",

      "content": "It frustrates me when people only tie this movie to the de-aging or claim it was “ too long “ or that they stopped their watch after 20 minutes, and not deep dive into the grand scheme Scorsese portrayed with this. It is a masterpiece. The heavy themes and emotional depth poured into the story left me with a blank emptiness for days on my first watch and the final act of the film is Scorseses best. It’s centered around a man’s slow collapse into nothingness and how he is forced to confront the life that he lived at the very end, not able to process his behavior until he’s been reduced to isolation. Franks actions throughout the movie cost him a relationship with his daughter whom he loved, and the final 45 minutes Frank is forced to live with that, in abandonment and regretfulness, alone with himself and his meaningless “ loyalty “ to the mafia as death is around the corner. That is what the movie is all about imo, the cost of power and how it fades out on you. \n\n\nThe entire cast killed it. they all had great chemistry. Anna Pacquin’s character had little dialogue yet told everything with her facial expressions aka “ I know what you’ve done “ as Frank cannot hide the truth. Joe Pesci was phenomenal. I think the score and directing was perfectly executed. The pacing is intentionally slow and pays it off with the final 3rd of the movie. It’s unlike any crime film ever made. \n\nObviously a hot take, and I’d be very open to opinions or your other favorite movies but I just can’t stand when people give up on this movie so easily, or hold a bias towards it because of the de-aging or that one beating up scene. I can’t find a single true flaw in the storytelling. It’s not a real life accurate movie, but it’s my favorite movie oat.\n\n\n\n\n",

I live in DeKalb County, TN, where animal cruelty and neglect cases are almost never prosecuted.\n\nRecently, a local hobby farmer reported on Facebook that three dogs came onto her property and killed three or four of her loose chickens. The chickens were not kept in a fenced area and are known to roam freely. In her post, she stated that she chased down the dogs and \"dispatched\" them.\n\nWhile Tennessee law does allow property owners to defend their livestock from dogs, my understanding is that once she caught the dogs, tied them to trees, and then shot them, her actions fell under animal cruelty. Initially, she claimed to have killed all three dogs, but later she changed her story in the comments, saying she only shot the husky. It’s unclear why she lied about the other two, but she has a history of being problematic in the past.\n\nShe also explicitly stated that any other stray dogs found on her property would also be killed.\n\nGiven these facts, do I have a case here? Am I waisting my time being angry about this? ",

      "title": "[Massachusetts] Should I press charges, sue, or have a restraining order on my maniacal neighbor after this incidence?",
      "content": "Location: Massachusetts\n\nThis happened a few weeks ago. My neighbor and I **were once friends prior to this incident.** He’d come over and eat with us, and we’d go out. We’d do favors also for one another and my GF and I were even close to his ex-GF. \n\nAnyways, he had a new girl over to his place that day in August 4th, and I was socializing with her and becoming her friend. I was very careful to not speak vulgar, to not flirt, and to praise this neighbor of mine, who I’ll call HA. Basically, I was being friendly, but not at all flirty, and I wasn’t speaking vulgarly at all but more like as a brother would speak to a sister. \n\nHA, when he drinks (or maybe when he does hard drugs like cocaine, since he’s been acting very maniacal the last two months) gets angry. We’ve heard him and even been around him as he shouted at different women in the last two months, throw things around, and slam doors in our presence. \n\nHA got really jealous when his new female companion and I talked, and he threw my cutting board and cutting knife outside that I brought to his apartment to cook some food for them on-premise. I humbly apologized to him in front of that girl, but he was still angry. \n\nThen that woman freaked out and left. He was in a very agitated state, and she quickly blocked him on her phone. Later on I found out that she called one of her big, strong friends for emotional support and maybe protection. \n\n[Next thing you know, HA started bombarding me with very mean and profane texts.](https://imgur.com/gallery/was-this-simple-assault-verbal-abuse-QfbDyFY) you can see that he says “f*ck you” at least 5 times. I apologized to him via text this time as you can see. \n\nJust before his last text to me, he slammed his door open and shouted very loudly “F*CK!” and went for a walk. \n\nI got really scared. \n\n* Was this simple assault? He didn’t threaten me as you can see.\n* Was any of these actions illegal?\n* Should I have called the police? \n* Could I sue him or press charges?",

      "title": "Assaulted at work by another employee",
      "content": "Location: Louisiana\n\nTL;DR: I was assaulted at work by an employee who then pulled a knife on another employee while fleeing. She was arrested and charged with two counts. What are the next steps? I don't feel safe at work anymore and I'm sure there's a court case I need to get ready for too.\n\n\n\n\n\nLong version: I'm the general manager of a fast-food place. The operations manager scheduled an interview for this girl a couple of weeks ago, and she seemed great. She was really sweet, and I thought she would be a good fit on the team. The position was for a delivery driver.\n\nOn day one, she came in with a completely different personality but the shift went fine. On day three, she came in and told me she didn't need me to tell her what deliveries to take anymore and that she could do it on her own, but that's not how it works. I route all the drivers, and always have. I told her that, and she said, \"Oh, okay.\" I thought that was that, but a day later, she's emailing the operations manager saying that I'm not being fair in routing the deliveries. Honestly, I really don't know why she thinks that because she was actually doing really well, and I made sure to tell her she was doing great and moving deliveries quickly. She was neck and neck with the other drivers. So, she thinks I'm unfair for whatever reason.\n\nWe had two days off, then came back to work, and we were getting busy. I assigned her an order, and she said, \"I'd rather take this other order because I know the place.\" I said, \"But that one's not up first and is going in the opposite direction of the one you're up next to take.\" The address was wrong on the receipt, and I tried to tell her what building she was supposed to go to, but she still ended up going to the wrong building. She came back in and threw the order at me as I was on the phone with a customer and demanded I fix the ticket. Then she went to the office and stopped working. \n\nI went back there to tell her that, 1. I am the one in charge here, and she will not come in and make demands of me, and 2. She needs to get back on the road and take deliveries. She started arguing about how I'm being unfair and that she's in contact with my managers to do something about it. I told her i wasn't being unfair and following the orders as they were received but she wasn't having it and started yelling. After she started screaming in the store and causing a scene, I told her she needed to leave the store now. She refused to leave, and I threatened to get the cops. I guess hearing that triggered her, and she sucker-punched me in the eye twice. I fell back into the corner of the cooler and have a gnarly bruise on my back. She tried to run out, and another employee tried to stop her, but she pulled a knife, so he backed up. Luckily, there was a cop in the building, and he tackled her out the door, and she was arrested. We pressed charges, and I know she got two charges: one for battery for the punch and the other for the knife (I don't remember what he said that charge was).\n\nI haven't returned to work in two days, and truthfully, I really don't want to go back. The location we are in is a downtown area and kind of sketchy. I was already on edge daily, but there's a police station nearby that made me feel a little better. Obviously, my bosses want me to return ASAP, but I really, really, really, really don't want to go back. I'm so lost. I don't know what to do and don't think I'll ever feel safe in this position again. How am I supposed to manage people if they can just sucker-punch me out of nowhere? And she had a knife on her, too! She could have stabbed me or any other employee. Oh, and side note, I googled her name after she assaulted me, and she had an attempted murder charge already. Like, omg, we dropped the ball so hard, and of course, we don't do background checks; it's fast food.\n\nI went to an urgent care to get X-rays on my face and back, they came out good but I can barely move or lift my left arm because of this bruise on my back. The corner of the cooler went right into my shoulder blade and there's a long bruise going down my back. I have pictures of all the bruising and every single second of this incident was caught on the store's security camera and already sent to police for the case.\n\nSo, what's next? What do I do about my job, and not only that, but I'm going to have a court case I have to deal with on top of that? Can I get a restraining order? Is it possible she was released? I think I need a lawyer, but I am flat broke. ",

He's done some very unhinged things, started punching me and smashing my things on a few occasions this past year. He's an aggressive person all around. Occasional fights with my mom, a tendency to raise his voice at all the family members, he's almost gotten into a physical altercation with grandpa once as well. There was also this instance he was attempting to drill a hole into our wall to get to the neighbors side during the night, screaming at them to shut up and yelling obscenities while they were having what I'd assume to be cultural festivities. This was when I was pretty young and I thought it was funny at the time, and I think that's telling. He's an unhinged person and things like this will escalate. I don't feel consistently safe. He's received no consequences for his actions. Maybe the next time he gets violent it won't be his fists, maybe it'll be a few chairs thrown in my face, maybe it'll be an object like a broom, or even a knife. My grandparents *will* lie for him, my brother probably as well, so there's no knowing what he'll do. I'm getting older, maybe he feels comfortable throwing fists at a fifteen year old girl, what will he be comfortable with when I'm 18. Please help me. What things should I document, what things should I prepare for, I need some leverage, a backup plan if anything ever happens? If the police ever come I don't know if they'd believe me, I've been institutionalized for depression thrice, yes my dad has been institutionalized twice in this past year as well but I don't think that's enough.

      "title": "4 years ago my Mom killed my Dad.  And nothing has been done about it.",
      "content": "That is the TLDR, I've tried to write this story many times these last 4 years but hopefully this is it.  I'm not using a throwaway because maybe I can hope somehow something comes of this. Ages are going to be at the time of the event.\n\n\n\nOn September 24, 2021, my Dad (64) died in a house fire in his family home he shared with my mom (60) and my youngest brother (19).  The \"official\" story I believe ended up being a tea light candle burning on an end table was responsible for lighting the curtain on fire in the living room, roughly 6 feet from where my father was sleeping. Medicated in his hospital bed unable to get up if he did wake up and want to.\n\n\n\nMy dad was a good person, he was a wonderful father yet somewhat old fashioned.  He coached teams he was always teaching us things that we needed to know, like fixing the screen in a window.  He never hit us but he was respected.  He smoked, he drank, he shared his love of golf and bowling to all 6 of us. Above all he worked hard.  My dad started a job at the local Quarry when I was 6 months old and worked there for the next 35 years, 70 hours a week of back breaking labor every day 4 am but was always there for us.   He was the glue that kept the family together, and that has only become more and more apparent. \n\n\n\nJust around a year before the fire, my dad had a pretty serious stroke.  The signs were there that he had been having mini-strokes and all the kids were vocal to him and mom that they needed to check it out.  They didn't, and it happened.  This really opened my eyes to the type of person my mom really is, and recalled a lot of things growing up that I had either repressed or convinced myself that it was normal.  However that is for another day.\n\n\n\nThings that I found out after my dad's stroke.  My mom had been using a friend of my sisters husband for health insurance, and he had been arrested for fraud and she didn't get new insurance.  She just stopped paying bills altogether and their heat/electric/water bill was nearly 1000 and threatening to get shut off.  The house was getting ready to be foreclosed on.  And thru all of this she skipped rehab and doctors appointments for him.  Wouldn't do the exercises at home, or ask for help for these things, just lied and lied and lied.  There was help available.  the family of my older brother (44) sister (38) and the younger sister and their spouses and their 8 kids aged 5-19 in a small town of 1000 people.  Sorry I'm rambling.\n\n\n\nDuring this time my mom did very little other than stay home and go to her friends house and get high, on what idk specifically but definitely weed.  She had problems with pills in the past, not sure how in the past that is/was.  All the kids spent time with dad, I admit I did not visit as often as I should have, but I couldn't.  The man stuck in bed staring at whatever fucking fox news bs my mom had on in front of him, it wasn't my dad.  He could hold a conversation at times, lost focus easily but the spark was there occasionally.  It broke my heart, and more and more I resented my mom.  She would try and complain to me when I came around how she has no free time, and \"it's such a burden\" made me sick.  I brought it up to my siblings, but there's only so much you can do sometimes, family is complicated.\n\n\n\nThe day of the fire I was on my way home from work and got the call from her she just said \"The house is on fire and your dad is dead\"  I said \"What?!\" ands she hung up.  So I stepped on the gas and sped to my childhood home, pulled up and it was ablaze, I saw my mom (whom had already moved her car back by the garage \"to clean it\") and walked to her, I said nothing and she just kept saying, in a tone that was kind of angry not sad, \"sorry I killed your dad\".  As my siblings showed up one at a time as several towns of fire workers work on containing the fire I walk away and talk to and process with others.  I already said it's a small town so once word started to spread a lot of people wandered over.  Once the fire was out around 40 volunteer firefighters held up tarps so they could remove my dad.  With my brothers I watched them carry him out and get him covered, I will remember that forever, my mom stayed back, just kind of hanging out.\n\n\n\nOver the next several days obviously I spent time with my siblings, we had a memorial \"party\" for him and family came from out of town etc. During this time I talked to my family about the story and it just seemed more and more off.  like the table where the candle was, was too far from the curtain to reach without the wind blowing in, turns out the windows were shut at the time.  Also she claimed she was sitting on the front porch reading, this would be one wall and maybe 6 total steps away from where the fire started.  \n\n\n\nSo, all of the money problems, the care \"burden\" for my dad, the house, the cars, all can be taken care of now.  She gets his 401k, pension, life insurance.  I reached out to the county fire marshal 3 weeks after the fire to tell him how I felt and asked him to look into it.  Next time I heard from him I was asked for my siblings info and I did not hear again.  A few months go by and I reached out again, I was told at that time the State Fire Mashal had taken over and I was able to get in touch with him.  He actually talked to me for almost 3 hours.  He said things didn't add up.  Thought she did it but couldn't just prove it.\n\n\n\nThat was the last time I heard from anyone.  I have emailed each Fire Marshal and not received any reply.  My mom (as far as I know)  is living in my sisters basement and getting high all day.  I haven't talked to her since the memorial, I don't talk to my sisters since they know how I feel and they don't agree. \n\n\n\nI'm not sure what I want now or how to get over this, hopefully it helps.  I'll answer questions, if there is too many I might update but idk, I just miss my dad.",

We don't have parents that are really in the picture at this time. \nThree weeks ago, my brother texted me and asked me to help him move out of and get away from an abusive relationship. My husband and I immediately moved him into our spare room, got his stuffed moved out, and everything seemed to be going well. He found a room he was going to start renting that seemed like a great situation, he was applying to jobs closer to it and was getting responses. \nLast Monday my husband and I both took NyQuil to fight the cold we were dealing with and said good night to my brother. We got woken up at 5:30 by calls from my brother's ex. Apparently around 1:30 he decided to leave our house, take an entire bottle of his pills, and went to see ex for closure before he planned to die. Ex got him on an ambulance and woke us up asap. \nTuesday through Thursday was spent in the hospital at his side. I slept in my car or in the bed next to him. I held his hand and sat there while we waited to see if anything he took would have a lasting effect on him going forward. But he was alive and I held it together for him.\nHe has been in inpatient since Saturday. He comes home to us tomorrow. I am grateful that I'll know where he is but my anxiety levels are very very high. How will I sleep knowing he can slip out of the house in the middle of the night again? How do I go to work knowing he has access to a car, and kitchen knives, and knowing he will be by himself?\nI feel so guilty for feeling like this but I wish the responsibility of him and what's to come could go to someone else. I didn't ask to be a mom and to be his main emotional support. I will do it and do everything I can for him because I love him, don't get me wrong. But I'm so incredibly tired. ",
